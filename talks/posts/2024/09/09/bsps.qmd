The DEBIAS team participated in the British Society for Population Studies conference in Bath. Francisco organised and chaired the session *"Migration 2: Migration, digital traces and methodological innovations"*. Carmen delivered a talk on the use of mobile phone data from Meta to assess the medium-term impact of COVID-19 on mobility in Latin American countries. The DEBIAS team have developed a methodology to address some key biases in these data. Keeps your eyes peeled for the publication coming up.
