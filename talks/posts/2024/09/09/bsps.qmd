The DEBIAS team participated in the [British Society for Population Studies](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-development/research/british-society-for-population-studies) conference in Bath. Francisco organised and chaired the session *"Migration 2: Migration, digital traces and methodological innovations"*. Carmen delivered a talk titled "The impact of COVID-19 on mobility patterns in Latin America", including research findings obtained from the analysis of mobile phone data from Meta to assess the medium-term effects of COVID-19 on internal mobility in Argentina, Colombia and Chile. The DEBIAS team have developed a methodology to address some key biases in these data. Keeps your eyes peeled for the publication coming up.
