Digital trace data, such as location data collected from smartphone apps, offers a unique opportunity to analyse population movements at high spatiotemporal granularity, with extensive coverage in near real-time. Yet, a key challenge for its use in human mobility research and evidence-based policymaking is the presence of biases. These issues were addressed in the keynote talk titled "Leveraging digital trace data for human mobility research" and delivered at UrbanSys, a satellite session within the Conference on Complex Systems, taking place in Exeter (UK) in early September 2024.
